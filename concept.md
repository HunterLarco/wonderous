### Brain Storm

**Idea One**

the less you reveal the more people can wonder.

Chapter 1. Alone.

black pulsing ball with ambient music. pulses as a blob, not a circle.

on tap a high ring goes off and it expands until the field of sight is black

"who are you?"

and now a girls outline shimmers and changes on the screen on a line.

you can tap to make her walk and drag to maker her run.
(arrows on bottom corners of the screen)

you run through scenes you see many things and small flickers in the screen as you run the screen gets lighter until you find the white blob.

you walk into it. the blob expands and inverts the colors again.

Chapter 2. Isolation.

on the other side of the screen you see someone, but when you walk towards them they dart away.

as you continue towards them the screen morphs and a box closes on you until forming a line a disapearing. you are gone. and the screen is black.

"is anyone listening?"

when you tap sounds play in the distance. each sound briefly shows light across the screen and you can see the girl curled in the fetal position in the corner.

after the first tap she no longer shows.

**Paint in Air**

draw on your soroundings and come back later to find them again
